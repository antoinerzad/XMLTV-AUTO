<title lang="fr">Dickey Betts</title>
<desc lang="fr">Dickey Betts - Calling Dickey Betts the second guitarist in the Allman Brothers Band does him a disservice. After the tragic death of Duane Allman in 1971, Betts became co-captain with Gregg Allman, leading the group through ups and downs over the decades. Known as one of the most influential guitar players of all time, Betts has mastered a seamless style of lyrical melody and rhythm — marrying country, jazz, blues, and rock into one sound. Betts has one of the most distinctive voices in music today, and on July 21, 2018, he brought down the house at the St. George's Theatre in Staten Island. Catch him performing the legendary Allman Brothers songs!</desc>

Today, Zukan has commissioned, revised and released more than a dozen pieces by national and international composers such as: María Eugenia Luc, Mikel Chamizo, Isabel Urrutia, Francisco José Domínguez, Vassilis Filippou, etc. The group is one of the most consolidated groups on the contemporary music scene in the Basque Country.
