<title lang="fr">Rip Off Britain</title>
<desc lang="fr">From a brand new home, Rip Off Britain HQ in Salford, Angela Rippon, Gloria Hunniford and Julia Somerville are joined by Britain's best consumer experts to help solve the problems you send in every day. In this edition, we reveal customer service failures at one of the country's biggest energy firms, including the case of one woman whose account went from being £200 in credit to £6,000 in debt within days. We ask the new boss whether customer service is going to get better. Plus more frustration for customers of Britain's most complained about pay TV provider, and how one woman ended up with a £5,000 bill for a car accident that wasn't her fault - all because she unwittingly dialled the wrong number.</desc>

<desc lang="fr">Chef James Martin takes to the skies to explore how the beautiful and unique landscape of the British Isles produces distinct and delicious regional ingredients. He explores the fertile plains and lowlands of east Scotland to understand why Scottish whisky is not only considered the best in the world, but a true reflection of the landscape in which it is made. He also discovers why the raspberries grown near Strathmore are a class apart and such a sought-after ingredient. On his journey he prepares a whisky-cured salmon with beetroot dressing and blinis and a raspberry panna cotta with homemade mini doughnuts.</desc>
