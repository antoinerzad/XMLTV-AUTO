<title lang="fr">Skeleton Sea</title>
<desc lang="fr">João and Xandi, two surfers in their early 50's, have been working together for 25 years. They clean beaches and with the trash they pick they create the most stunning artwork. However, living as an artist and idealist in Portugal is not economically profitable and, therefore, not easy. Their family life is affected by the choices they make and their wish to raise awareness about the ever-growing pollution in our oceans. Skeleton Sea takes us on their personal journey to help people understand the importance of our oceans to help us take the step to change our habits to keep them clean. As all live comes from the sea, Skeleton Sea reminds us that this powerful force has the ability of taking it away from us as well.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Tahitian Swells</title>
<desc lang="fr">French Polynesia is world famous for the quality of its waves, to the delight of surfers all over the world. These waves are generated by the swell; an undulating movement of the sea surface, without breaking. And if French Polynesia is one of the kingdoms of surfing, it is thanks to its geographical location. Nestled in the heart of the South Pacific, this group of five archipelagos, which covers an area as vast as Europe, benefits all year round from swells generated by the four winds. The conditions are therefore ideal for the many wave lovers, whether surfing, windsurfing, bodyboarding, canoeing, etc. To make the most of these ocean pleasures, a knowledge of marine forecasting is essential.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Skeleton Sea</title>
<desc lang="fr">João and Xandi, two surfers in their early 50's, have been working together for 25 years. They clean beaches and with the trash they pick they create the most stunning artwork. However, living as an artist and idealist in Portugal is not economically profitable and, therefore, not easy. Their family life is affected by the choices they make and their wish to raise awareness about the ever-growing pollution in our oceans. Skeleton Sea takes us on their personal journey to help people understand the importance of our oceans to help us take the step to change our habits to keep them clean. As all live comes from the sea, Skeleton Sea reminds us that this powerful force has the ability of taking it away from us as well.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Tahitian Swells</title>
<desc lang="fr">French Polynesia is world famous for the quality of its waves, to the delight of surfers all over the world. These waves are generated by the swell; an undulating movement of the sea surface, without breaking. And if French Polynesia is one of the kingdoms of surfing, it is thanks to its geographical location. Nestled in the heart of the South Pacific, this group of five archipelagos, which covers an area as vast as Europe, benefits all year round from swells generated by the four winds. The conditions are therefore ideal for the many wave lovers, whether surfing, windsurfing, bodyboarding, canoeing, etc. To make the most of these ocean pleasures, a knowledge of marine forecasting is essential.</desc>
