<title lang="fr">See Hear S43</title>
<desc lang="fr">It's the one-year anniversary of the BSL Act, and Wendy Daunt is at the BDA conference to see what the impact on daily life has been. Back in the studio, renowned author Paddy Ladd pops in to discuss his new book on deaf education. In Hertfordshire, Deepa Shastri visits Woodside Primary school, one of 14 schools in the Ivy Learning Trust. Inspired by the work of deaf educator Tina Kemp, BSL classes have been rolled out across all the schools, regardless of whether the children are deaf or hearing. For the first time in 42 series of See Hear, the programme is removing its dubbed voices to more authentically represent deaf people, as well as normalise the natural deaf voice.</desc>
