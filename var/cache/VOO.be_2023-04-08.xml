<title lang="fr">Celebrity Best Home Cook S1</title>
<desc lang="fr">It's the quarter-final, and Mary Berry challenges the cooks to produce their ultimate celebration cake. The cakes can be any shape, size or flavour but must celebrate an event, and the type of event must be obvious from the design. For Chris Bavin's Rustle Up challenge, they are tasked with making the humble chickpea the star of their dishes. Then, Angela Hartnett sets one of her hardest eliminators to date, asking the cooks to produce three different Asian-inspired dishes within a very short space of time. At the end of a close blind tasting, the judges announce who will be leaving the competition and missing out on a place in the semi-final.</desc>
