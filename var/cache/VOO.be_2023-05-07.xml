<title lang="fr">Countryfile</title>
<desc lang="fr">There is no surer sign that spring is here than millions of lambs being born across the UK. Charlotte Smith visits the Outer Hebrides to meet teenage farmer Archie, who despite only being 17, already runs a 600-acre farm on the island of North Uist. Paralympian Sammi Kinghorn is back home lambing on her family farm in the Scottish Borders. She grew up there, developing a love of animals and farming, but it's also where she suffered the accident that left her paralysed; something that's never stopped her helping with lambing. Veterinary student Olivia Linares is fulfilling a lifelong dream as she embarks on her first ever lambing season in Hampshire. And, in north Wales, there is a look at how wool fleeces might be helping to make the UK's next great wine.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Beechgrove Garden</title>
<desc lang="fr">Ahead of the coronation weekend, there is a slight royal theme to the work going on at Beechgrove Garden. Carole Baxter and Calum Clunie will be planting delphiniums, reportedly one of the favourite flowers of HM King Charles III. Elsewhere in the garden, Carole starts to refresh the planting in the Garden for Wildlife with a selection of varieties known to help pollinators and other species. Calum replants some of his underperforming roses from the end of last year, and Brian Cunningham sends another report on the work he is doing at his garden in Perthshire. And there is the next in Beechgrove's Back to Basics skills guide.</desc>
