<title lang="fr">Garden Rescue S8</title>
<desc lang="fr">Riya and Nanda have a sad and unloved garden in Groby, with an outdated pink and yellow 'Battenburg' patio, a tumbledown shed and a huge gravel slope. This really is a plot that needs to be rescued, especially as Riya is soon to be married, and they are hoping to host some of the celebrations in the garden. Desperate for some inspiration, they've asked the team to create a garden fit for the upcoming nuptials, but also a lovely space for mum Nanda, once the wedding is over, all for £3,500. They would like Charlie and Flo to pick up on the reds and golds of Riya's wedding colours in the planting, but most of all they want the gravel slope gone. They'd like generous seating areas and storage, as well as a herb garden for keen cook Nanda. It's a long wish list - can Charlie and Flo deliver?</desc>
