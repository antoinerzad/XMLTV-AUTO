<desc lang="fr">There is no surer sign that spring is here than millions of lambs being born across the UK. Charlotte Smith visits the Outer Hebrides to meet teenage farmer Archie, who despite only being 17, already runs a 600-acre farm on the island of North Uist. Paralympian Sammi Kinghorn is back home lambing on her family farm in the Scottish Borders. She grew up there, developing a love of animals and farming, but it's also where she suffered the accident that left her paralysed; something that's never stopped her helping with lambing. Veterinary student Olivia Linares is fulfilling a lifelong dream as she embarks on her first ever lambing season in Hampshire. And, in north Wales, there is a look at how wool fleeces might be helping to make the UK's next great wine.</desc>

<title lang="fr">The Great British Sewing Bee S8</title>
<desc lang="fr">A place in the quarter-final is at stake this week, and the challenges are all about lingerie. Host Sara Pascoe starts the sewers off with a fiddly pattern for a lace underwired bra and matching knicker set. With such small pattern pieces, there is no margin for error, and Patrick and Esme's eagle eyes will spot every mistake. The Transformation Challenge requires the sewers to take thermal underwear and turn it into daywear. Then male models fill the sewing room to be fitted for a pair of luxury pyjamas. One sewer wins Garment of the Week and another is asked to leave the Sewing Room.</desc>

A daily winner is declared following a quickfire round at the end of each show, and the scores are tallied across the week, resulting in an overall champion being crowned on Friday. Will the winning stars opt for the much-coveted House of Games wheelie luggage, or will they be tempted by the House of Games reusable coffee mug, which is brand new for this series?</desc>
