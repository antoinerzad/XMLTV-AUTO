<title lang="fr">Rios Patagonicos</title>
<desc lang="fr"> For several years, the Regard sur l'Aventure association has been organising scientific explorations and athletic expeditions. In 2018, the &quot;Rios Patagonicos&quot; expedition leads 15 canyoneers to explore the vastness of Chilean Patagonia, in search for rivers and waterfalls. Their goal: explore untouched territories, spot and open over 30 canyons, on a unique territory, where the discipline of canyoning is almost non-existent. For some, &quot;Rios Patagonicos&quot; is the opportunity to go on an expedition for the first time. For others, more skilled canyoneers it's the occasion to share their experience on sometimes difficult terrain. At the heart of the glacial valleys of Patagonia, everyone comes together for the same desire: to share a sporty and humane adventure. A trip which will thrill the expedition members, awakes fears and team spirit.</desc>

<desc lang="fr">Four young surfers who have endured poverty, abandonment, abuse and death find refuge in the ocean on a journey to not let their pasts define who they will become. Time Well Spent was created by James Fazio, a surfer and filmmaker who wanted to give a life changing trip to four young men from different walks of life around the world. We will lead you to each boys front doorsteps in Indonesia, Hawaii, Peru and Australia to hear their stories and learn where they come from. The message this documentary gives is: it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from, you have worth and can give hope to others. This is an inspiring movie that shares their stories to the world and give hope to others who can relate to the trials these four have faced.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Time Well Spent</title>
<desc lang="fr">Four young surfers who have endured poverty, abandonment, abuse and death find refuge in the ocean on a journey to not let their pasts define who they will become. Time Well Spent was created by James Fazio, a surfer and filmmaker who wanted to give a life changing trip to four young men from different walks of life around the world. We will lead you to each boys front doorsteps in Indonesia, Hawaii, Peru and Australia to hear their stories and learn where they come from. The message this documentary gives is: it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from, you have worth and can give hope to others. This is an inspiring movie that shares their stories to the world and give hope to others who can relate to the trials these four have faced.</desc>
