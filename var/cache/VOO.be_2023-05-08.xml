<title lang="fr">The Great British Sewing Bee S8</title>
<desc lang="fr">Music Week brings three different musical and sartorial genres to the Sewing Bee. Sara Pascoe kicks off the week with a pattern for the parka coat that was adopted by Mod culture in the 1960s. With its classic fishtail vent and complex zip opening and hood, this is a feat of engineering. Country music is the inspiration for the Transformation Challenge, as the sewers take old denim and turn it into stage gear worthy of Dolly Parton. Finally, the Made to Measure is an homage to David Bowie and his many incarnations. The sewers pay tribute with Bowie-inspired outfits fitted to a model.</desc>
