<title lang="fr">Null + Void</title>
<desc lang="fr">Null + Void - While few people are familiar with the Null + Void project, many have already heard Kurt Uenala's music. After making his debut under the pseudonym Kap10Kurt in 2003, Uenala caught the attention of the world with the play &quot;Die Sleeping&quot;. This critical and popular success has led to collaborations with several big names in music, including Moby, The Kills, and Dave Gahan, singer of Depeche Mode, for whom Uenala has subsequently signed plays. Spending more and more time in his Manhattan studio, Uenala developed a unique sound made of angular beats and dark soundscapes, which gave rise to a new melancholy solo project called Null + Void. Cryosleep, Uenala's first album under this new banner, includes several titles inspired by retro science fiction, new wave and electronic innovators.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Mosè in Egitto</title>
<desc lang="fr">Mosè in Egitto - The spectacular Milan Cathedral - the fifth-largest church in the world, which took six centuries to build - provides the setting for this lavish performance of Gioachino Rossini's opera &quot;Mosè&quot;. Rossini created &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot; for the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in 1818-19 but later revised and expanded it for the Paris Opera. The French opera &quot;Moïse et Pharaon&quot;, of which Mosè is the Italian transcript, is a dropsical affair, decked out with ballet sequences, and embellished with the kind of effects Cecil B de Mille would later favor when dealing with Biblical epics. There is nothing of that here. In this pared-down Mosè, the action focuses on Moses's confrontations with the Egyptians and Amenofi's (Pharaoh's son) love for Moses's niece Anaide.</desc>
