<desc lang="fr">Every year, 30,000 missionaries are called to serve the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints across the globe - the largest full-time missionary force of any church. Most are under 25 and away from home for up to two years - and the biggest training centre in Europe is located in Chorley, Lancashire. This documentary follows the journey of three young missionaries through the first few months of training and work in the field, which can make or break them.</desc>

Each episode sees the eight rivals compete over a different course, from starter through to dessert, where they are marked out of ten by an expert judging panel which, each episode, features a different well-known guest judge. This time, it's award-winning comedian and actor Kulvinder Ghir, the voice in such animations as Bob the Builder, Thomas and Friends, and Postman Pat. The chefs cook their vegan starter courses for him in a bid to secure the first place on the menu at the banquet.</desc>
