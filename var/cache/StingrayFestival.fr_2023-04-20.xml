<title lang="fr">Omar Sosa : Quarteto Afrocubano</title>
<sub-title lang="fr">Au Théâtre de Villefranche-sur-Saône</sub-title>
<desc lang="fr">Omar Sosa - Quarteto Afrocubano - While always keeping one foot firmly anchored in the traditions of his home country, Cuba, Omar Sosa tirelessly explores music from the Caribbean to India, and West Africa to the Arab world. Since he left Cuba in 1993, the pianist has been blending his Afro-Cuban roots with jazz, hip hop, electro and world music. For his 2018 performance at Théâtre de Villefranche-sur-Saône, he brings to stage his Quarteto Afrocubano members Childo Tomas (electric bass &amp; vocals), Ernesto Simpson (drums), and Leandro Saint-Hill (saxophones, flute, percussion &amp; vocals). Together, they create a riveting instrumental dialogue. Celebrating rhythm in all its forms, this Omar Sosa concert is an intense and mystical experience.</desc>
