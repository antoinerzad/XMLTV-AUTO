<title lang="fr">San Borondón</title>
<desc lang="fr">The popular legend claims San Borondón is an island that appears and disappears, normally under a heavy veil of fog. As adventurers departed on missions to be the first to locate it, not all returned from the depths of the ocean. Now, San Borondón is the name many local and international surfers have given to a dangerous wave spot on the Canary Islands. The film producer Rayco Cano, his team and five big wave riders embrace us in their story about these huge waves. The film features windsurfing pro Daniel Bruch, German big wave surfer Alexander Zirke, Manuel Lezcano, Ayoze Fernandea and David Rodal Santiago Vilayta. San Borondón stands for big wave surfing and adrenalin driven surfers, who risk a lot on their surfing boards and SUPs. The jet ski is a necessary safety tool.</desc>

<desc lang="fr">Ofqui - A thaw surf film. For seven years now, we have been approaching the vast territory of Patagonia in different ways, and this time, we have been able to locate a site with world class waves. Crossing the Ofqui Isthmus, a stretch of land that separates the Pacific Ocean's inland seas, is the only way to make it if you want to surf the shores of Golfo de Penas. This is a surf film of an expedition looking for the waves of the thaw (an exhaustible resource.)</desc>
