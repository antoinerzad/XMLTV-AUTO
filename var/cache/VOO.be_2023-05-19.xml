<title lang="fr">MasterChef S19</title>
<desc lang="fr">It's the fourth quarter-final, and this week's most talented four cooks return to fight for a place in Knockout Week. They face just one intense challenge. They must cook two courses that will excite not just John and Gregg, but also some of MasterChef's most inspiring winners, finalists and contestants, who have all gone on to careers in the food industry. Their fate is in the hands of two MasterChef champions - from 2020, Thomas Frake, and from 2010, Dhruv Baker - and the finalist from 2021, Alexina Anatole. With just two Knockout Week places up for grabs, these amateurs need to show real flair and ambition to edge closer to the MasterChef 2023 trophy.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Beechgrove Garden</title>
<desc lang="fr">Beechgrove Garden is planning for a colourful summer this week, planting for pollinators and caring for dahlias both on the programme. Kirsty Wilson and Lizzie Schofield will have the usual half hour of great gardening advice including a follow-up on how the dahlia tubers planted in pots in April are coming on, and what to do if you want to get some free plants by taking dahlia cuttings. Kirsty is sowing a bed around the viburnum that was moved last autumn, this new area will be home to plants particularly good for pollinators. Calum Clunie will be sending an update from his allotment in Fife and George Anderson is in Sunny Joppa. All that plus the start of a garden renovation for a family who has recently moved into a new build house that needs a new garden.</desc>
