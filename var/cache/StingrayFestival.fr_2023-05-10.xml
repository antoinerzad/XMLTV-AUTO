<title lang="fr">Caixa Cubo - Da Pá Virada Sessions</title>
<sub-title lang="fr">Quartabe</sub-title>
<desc lang="fr"> The Da Pá Virada Sessions series portrays the best musicians in Brazilian jazz today. All sessions were recorded in São Paulo and offer a unique experience: they offer a fresh look at the Brazilian music scene. The artists have been selected together with the music editor of Stingray DJAZZ. Among the bands featured in this series is Quartabê, a unique Brazilian quartet that draws from a wide variety of influences, including São Paulo's avant-garde movement, free improvisation, pop, and electronic music. Each of these influences is reflected in Quartabê's rousing live performances! Joana Queiroz (tenor saxophone and clarinets), Maria Beraldo Bastos (clarinets), Mariá Portugal (drums), and Chicão (keys) write, arrange, improvise and sing music that is all theirs.</desc>
