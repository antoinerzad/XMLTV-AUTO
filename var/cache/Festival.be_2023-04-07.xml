<title lang="fr">Matthew Dear</title>
<desc lang="fr">Matthew Dear - Matthew Dear is a shapeshifter, oscillating seamlessly between DJ, dance-music producer, and experimental pop auteur. He writes, produces, and mixes all of his work. He maintains four aliases (Audion, False, Jabberjaw, and Matthew Dear), each with its own style and distinct visual identity. He straddles multiple musical worlds and belongs to none, now nearly 20 years into his kaleidoscopic career, with five albums and two dozen EPs plus millions of miles in the rearview of his biography. Bunny, his fifth full-length released October 2018, parades down a rabbit hole of unhinged phrasings, dreams, and interludes. Bunny further confirms that Matthew Dear occupies a rarified corner of the musical universe: no longer tethered to any one genre, respected by his peers, and blessed with a bottomless well of creative energy.</desc>
