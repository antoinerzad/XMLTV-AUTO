<title lang="fr">Match of the Day 2</title>
<desc lang="fr">Gary Lineker introduces highlights of today's Premier League games, including Liverpool's clash with Brentford. It's been a topsy-turvy season for Jürgen Klopp's Reds, and they now face a tough test against Thomas Frank's Brentford side, who continue to punch above their weight and boast the prolific Ivan Toney in their ranks. Manchester City continue their attempt to win the Premier League for the third year running against relegation-battling Leeds, who lost 7-0 on their last visit to the Etihad Stadium and have conceded a total of 14 goals in their last three matches against Pep Guardiola's side. Elsewhere, Bournemouth will be searching for three points in their battle to secure Premier League survival as they take on Chelsea, Tottenham have a London derby at home against Crystal Palace, and Wolves welcome Aston Villa to Molineux.</desc>
