<title lang="fr">MasterChef S19</title>
<desc lang="fr">It's the second quarter-final, and this week's four most talented cooks return to fight for a place in Knockout Week. They face a single intense challenge. They must cook two courses that will excite not just John and Gregg but also some of MasterChef's most inspiring winners, finalists and contestants, who have all gone on to careers in the food industry. Their fate is in the hands of three MasterChef champions - Thomasina Miers, who won the trophy in 2005, Kenny Tutt, the winner in 2018, and 2017's Saliha Mahmood-Ahmed. With just two Knockout Week places up for grabs, these amateurs need to show real flair and ambition to edge closer to the MasterChef 2023 trophy.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Sounds of Liverpool at the BBC</title>
<desc lang="fr">It's the city that gave birth to the Beatles, inspired Gerry to ride that Ferry, and spawned Bunnymen and Atomic Kittens. Now with all eyes - and ears - on Liverpool for the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest, a look into the BBC's archives for a selection of performances from some of Merseyside's biggest and best-loved musical stars. Forget house music - this is scouse music, rich and varied, with some songs that conquered charts across the world and others that struck a special chord here - from The Story of the Blues to You'll Never Walk Alone, and inevitably, in a city with two massive football teams, Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Two Tribes.</desc>
