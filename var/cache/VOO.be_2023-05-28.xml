<title lang="fr">Countryfile</title>
<desc lang="fr">For the first of three visits this year, Sammi Kinghorn is on a hill farm in Cumbria, catching up with a passionate young farmer, 16-year-old Katie. From dawn to dusk, it's all go as Katie and Sammi get stuck into the daily chores and a surprise birth. But it's not just the farm keeping Katie busy this year - it's also GCSE year! Sammi finds out how this determined young lady is not fazed as she juggles her studies with caring for her animals. Adam Henson looks into the dangers facing sheep and lambs from an increase in dog attacks this year, Charlotte Smith investigates fears a 40-year-old chemical dump is threatening a village in Wales, and in a new strand, we meet four young farmers from around the country to follow their trials and tribulations over the next few months.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Barry Humphries at the BBC</title>
<desc lang="fr">When the great Barry Humphries passed away last month, the world said goodbye to a comedian whose antics had for years had kept presenters, interviewers and chat-show hosts on their toes, half-excited and half-terrified of what outrageous statement he, Dame Edna Everage or Sir Les Patterson might utter on live television. Alex Jones looks back at the highlights of Barry's career on a selection of BBC shows, sharing her own memories alongside some of Barry's funniest, rudest and most revealing moments from over the decades. It's a collection that demonstrates exactly why Sir Les and Dame Edna were loved by comedy fans across the world, while also highlighting how, while his two comic creations may have got all the attention, it was Barry who was really one of a kind.</desc>
