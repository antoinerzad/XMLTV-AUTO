<title lang="fr">MasterChef S19</title>
<desc lang="fr">It's the third quarter-final, and this week's most talented four cooks return to fight for a place in Knockout Week. They face just one intense challenge. They must cook two courses that will excite not just John and Gregg, but also some of MasterChef's most inspiring winners, finalists and contestants, who have all gone on to careers in the food industry. Their fate is in the hands of 2019's MasterChef champion Irini Tzortzoglou, Tom Rhodes, who won the trophy in 2021 and Nisha Parmar, who was a semi-finalist in 2018. With just two Knockout Week places up for grabs, these amateurs need to show real flair and ambition to edge closer to the MasterChef 2023 trophy.</desc>
