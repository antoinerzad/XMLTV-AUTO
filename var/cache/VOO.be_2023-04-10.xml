<title lang="fr">Impossible S5</title>
<desc lang="fr">Rick Edwards hosts Impossible - the quiz with a third dimension. In traditional quiz shows, questions have just right answers and wrong answers. But here there's a twist - the Impossible answer. It's not just wrong, it couldn't possibly be right. 19 contestants compete for a possible £10,000 jackpot. Right answers take them closer to the big money, but if at any stage they give an Impossible answer, they will immediately be knocked out. The winner of every show faces the £10,000 question. Three right answers will trigger a spectacular cascade of 10,000 pound coins from a giant exclamation mark, but a single Impossible answer means they will leave with nothing.</desc>
