<title lang="fr">Rip Off Britain</title>
<desc lang="fr">Gloria Hunniford, Julia Somerville and Angela Rippon investigate more of the stories you send in to our HQ every week. In today's edition, the case of a family whose once-loved home is now a wrecked shell after an insurance claim made six years ago went disastrously wrong. Also, in 2018, the then local government minister, Rishi Sunak, came on our programme to promise a new set of rules to keep private parking companies in check. While he's come a long way since then, the new rules appear to have stalled - we're asking why. And we help two mums and their 26-strong party of karate enthusiasts get a refund out of the airline that seems to be refusing their rights.</desc>
