<desc lang="fr">Ross Kemp presents as a team of four work colleagues - Tarlochan, Barry, Robert and Craig - take on the Bridge of Lies. One by one they all face the bridge, choosing who faces each crossing depending on the question category. Each bridge crossing has 32 potential steps - 22 truths and 10 lies - and they must cross by stepping on the truths and avoiding the lies, earning money for each correct answer. Once they have each faced the bridge on their own, those who have been successful will join forces to face the final crossing for a chance to take home the cash.</desc>
