<title lang="fr">Rip Off Britain</title>
<desc lang="fr">Gloria Hunniford, Angela Rippon and Julia Somerville are back in Rip Off Britain HQ to investigate more of the problems you send in every day. In this edition, there's trouble at one of Britain's biggest housing associations. We meet tenants living with damp, mould and a rat infestation. Gloria is joined in HQ by housing campaigner and tenant Kwajo Tweneboa, and she challenges one of the firm's bosses to commit to improving conditions. Also, the postcode lottery of recycling bin collections, which means you may not be able to recycle things that friends and family living in other councils might. And in our advice clinic, solicitor Ayesha Nayyar helps one man tackle the parking fine scam designed to scare you into paying up.</desc>

<title lang="fr">MasterChef S19</title>
<desc lang="fr">It's the end of Knockout Week, and the competition has now been whittled down to ten extremely talented amateur cooks, all of whom are desperate to reach the MasterChef semi-finals. Their challenge is to make a dish that the judges can eat with their hands. The stakes are high, because at the end, two contestants will be sent home and their dream of raising the MasterChef 2023 trophy will be over. For the remaining eight who have become semi-finalists, they are about to embark on a culinary adventure like no other.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Garden Rescue S8</title>
<desc lang="fr">Eleanor and Rob from Hereford would love an eco-friendly garden for themselves and their two daughters to enjoy. Of primary importance to the couple is that their garden is low/no carbon and that it is friendly to the environment. They would like the garden build to be based on a 'circular economy', ie any carbon spent would be offset by reusing materials. They want lots of habitats for birds, butterflies and bees and to use as many natural materials as possible. Also, Rob is South African, so barbecuing is in his DNA. He would love a purpose-built spot for a Braais in his new garden, and the couple would love some raised beds for their girls to grow their own. They have a budget of £4.5K, but with their current garden being a neglected concrete jungle, Chris and Charlie have their work cut out to give them everything they've asked for.</desc>
