<title lang="fr">Garden Rescue S8</title>
<desc lang="fr">Riya and Nanda have a sad and unloved garden in Groby, with an outdated pink and yellow &quot;Battenburg&quot; patio, a tumbledown shed and a huge gravel slope. This really is a plot that needs to be rescued, especially as Riya is soon to be married, and they are hoping to host some of the celebrations in the garden. Desperate for some inspiration, they've asked the team to create a garden fit for the upcoming nuptials, but also a lovely space for mum Nanda, once the wedding is over, all for £3.5K. They would like Charlie and Flo to pick up on the reds and golds of Riya's wedding colours in the planting, but most of all they want the gravel slope gone. They'd like generous seating areas and storage, as well as a herb garden for keen cook Nanda. It's a long wish list - can Charlie and Flo deliver?</desc>

<title lang="fr">MasterChef S19</title>
<desc lang="fr">After eight gruelling weeks of intense competition, the final three return to the MasterChef kitchen for the very last time as the search for the country's best amateur cook reaches its climax. Nothing short of exceptional will cut it. The finalists have one last chance to pull out all the stops, show everything they've learned along the way and in three hours demonstrate the kind of cook they have become. Tonight, they must produce the best three dishes of their lives, push their culinary boundaries and produce jaw-droppingly good food for the judges. To stand out, they must push themselves to the absolute limit and showcase their very best in what will be the biggest cook-off of their lives. It's now or never, as at the end only one will lift the trophy and become MasterChef Champion 2023.</desc>
