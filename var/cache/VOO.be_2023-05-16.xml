<title lang="fr">Eat Well for Less? S6</title>
<desc lang="fr">This week Gregg and Chris are tackling the biggest spenders ever seen on Eat Well for Less? The Gambling family believe that the more they spend, the better things will taste. Douglas and Angella are self-confessed foodies whose kitchen is stuffed with what they consider top-quality products. However, with a five-year-old and a three-year-old, cooking has taken a back seat, and they are increasingly relying on takeaways, sometimes from different restaurants in one evening. They also get a weekly delivery box of pre-measured ingredients that often don't get used. Not only that, they regularly enjoy eating out, and dad loves his coffee shop coffees and pastries. With a total average weekly spend of £430, it's the most expensive Gregg and Chris have ever seen.</desc>
