<title lang="fr">The World's Most Extraordinary Homes (USA) S2 (1/8)</title>
<desc lang="fr">«USA»Piers Taylor and Caroline Quentin travel from &quot;the boggy parts&quot; of South West Britain to Florida, USA to discover how high-end design and a celebrated architectural heritage combine to produce extraordinary homes. Canal House is for sale at nearly $30million! But does a price tag like that guarantee the very best in design? It certainly gets you an incredible waterfront plot on Miami's celebrated Indian Creek. And it also affords you a home designed by one of the world's top 100 architects Marcio Kogan. The house is essentially two striking concrete boxes stacked at right angles with an incredible cinemascopic façade, SET in a tropical landscape, AND entered by a long curving bridge. It's one of the largest homes ever to feature on the series. The second home is considerably smaller, but just as much an architectural heavy weight.</desc>
