<sub-title lang="fr">Kyle Eastwood Quintet</sub-title>
<desc lang="fr">Jazz à Ramatuelle: Kyle Eastwood Quintet - Bassist Kyle Eastwood (1968) is an explorer, equally at ease with jazz melodies as with pop songs. In the late 1970s, his father Clint took him to see his first jazz concert - a Count Basie performance. Eastwood Jr. was in awe of the drummer and wanted to play an instrument himself. It so happened he wasn't so much interested in jazz, preferring rhythm and blues, Motown and Stax records, funk groups, and North African and Indian music. Eastwood became a brilliant bassist and the composer of highly original soundtracks. His 2015 album &quot;Time Pieces&quot; is a collaboration with brilliant British musicians, such as trumpeter Quentin Collins and saxophonist Brandon Allen. In this broadcast, Eastwood and his fellow musicians revisit the hard bop legacy of Blue Note Records.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Mosè in Egitto</title>
<desc lang="fr">Mosè in Egitto - The spectacular Milan Cathedral - the fifth-largest church in the world, which took six centuries to build - provides the setting for this lavish performance of Gioachino Rossini's opera &quot;Mosè&quot;. Rossini created &quot;Mosè in Egitto&quot; for the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in 1818-19 but later revised and expanded it for the Paris Opera. The French opera &quot;Moïse et Pharaon&quot;, of which Mosè is the Italian transcript, is a dropsical affair, decked out with ballet sequences, and embellished with the kind of effects Cecil B de Mille would later favor when dealing with Biblical epics. There is nothing of that here. In this pared-down Mosè, the action focuses on Moses's confrontations with the Egyptians and Amenofi's (Pharaoh's son) love for Moses's niece Anaide.</desc>
