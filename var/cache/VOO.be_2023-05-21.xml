<title lang="fr">Gardeners' World</title>
<desc lang="fr">It's a good time to get tender plants in the ground now the risk of frost has passed. Monty is busy planting out tropical gingers and sweetcorn and direct sowing beans. Joe Swift visits a stunning walled garden in Denbighshire, designed and planted by owners who love to recycle and repurpose as much as they can. Rekha Mistry shares the secrets of her success for growing aubergines on her London allotment. There's a re-visit to farmer turned nurseryman Barry Proctor as he makes final preparations for his first RHS Chelsea Flower Show. And to coincide with Mental Health Awareness Week, journalist Rosie Kinchen explains how horticulture helped her deal with postnatal depression. Plus, more of the films that have been sent in by viewers.</desc>

<title lang="fr">Beechgrove Garden</title>
<desc lang="fr">Beechgrove Garden is planning for a colourful summer, planting for pollinators and caring for dahlias. Kirsty Wilson and Lizzie Schofield will have the usual half hour of great gardening advice, including a follow-up on how the dahlia tubers planted in pots in April are coming on, and what to do if you want to get some free plants by taking dahlia cuttings. Kirsty is sowing a bed around the viburnum that was moved last autumn, and this new area will be home to plants that are particularly good for pollinators. Calum Clunie will be sending an update from his allotment in Fife, and George Anderson is in Joppa. And it's the start of a garden renovation for a family who have recently moved into a new-build house.</desc>
