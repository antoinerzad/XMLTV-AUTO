<title lang="fr">24/7 Pet Hospital</title>
<desc lang="fr">A Pomeranian puppy called Bear has had an accident and caught her leg in a conservatory door. She sees surgeon Laura, who fits a tiny metal plate to fix her broken bones. It's not always easy treating dogs as small as Bear, but the team adapt. Meanwhile, a cat named Esme is brought in by her owner Kirsty as she has stopped eating and is being sick. As Esme arrives in the consulting room, the team take one look at her and rush her into ICU as they're concerned about her breathing. Colin, a basset hound, arrives for his check-up, supported by his sister Dolly. He has been suffering bouts of pneumonia, so his owner Andrew hopes the medication has helped and that he will get the all-clear.</desc>
