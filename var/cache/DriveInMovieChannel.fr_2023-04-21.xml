<desc lang="fr">The year is 1990; man has been traveling to and from the moon for twenty years, and is looking to move on to bigger and better celestial bodies. Dr. Farraday (Basil Rathbone) is thrilled when he receives evidence of what he believes to be the first-ever radio transmission to Earth from an alien race. Sure enough, the aliens communicate that they are sending down a peaceful delegation to make contact with the earthlings.</desc>
